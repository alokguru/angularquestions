Question: Why prioritize TypeScript over JavaScript in Angular?
Answer: TypeScript is developed by Microsoft and it is a superset of JavaScript. The issue with JS is that it isn’t a true OOP language.
As the JS code doesn’t follow the Prototype Pattern, the bigger the size of the code the messier it gets. Hence, it leads to difficulties in maintainability as well as reusability. To offset this, TypeScript follows a strict OOP approach.
