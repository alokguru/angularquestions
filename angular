Question: Why prioritize TypeScript over JavaScript in Angular?
Answer: TypeScript is developed by Microsoft and it is a superset of JavaScript. The issue with JS is that it isn’t a true OOP language.
As the JS code doesn’t follow the Prototype Pattern, the bigger the size of the code the messier it gets. 
Hence, it leads to difficulties in maintainability as well as reusability. To offset this, TypeScript follows a strict OOP approach.

Question: What is ViewEncapsulation and how many ways are there do to do it in Angular?
Answer: To put simply, ViewEncapsulation determines whether the styles defined in a particular component will affect the entire

Native – Styles used in other HTML doesn’t spread to the component
None – Styles defined in a component are visible to all components of the application

Question: What is the process called by which TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript code?
Answer: It is called Transpiling. Even though TypeScript is used for writing code in Angular applications, it gets internally transpiled 
into equivalent JavaScript.
